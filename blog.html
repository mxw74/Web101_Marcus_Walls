            <li>Describe one thing you learned in class today.</li>

                <ul><p>One thing I learned in class today is how to display information side-by-side using
                    display flex. This allows us to bypass the cascade effect seen in standard files. I found 
                    this to be particularly interesting and fun to play with. </p></ul>

            <li>Describe 2 pseudo-selectors and discuss what they are used for.</li>

                <ul><p>Two pseudo-selectors I learned about in class today are hover and first-letter. 
                    The hover pseudo selector allows you to make text change whenever a person's mouse 
                    hovers over the text. The first-letter pseudo selector tells our css file to select 
                    every first letter. This is typically used to drop caps. </p></ul>

            <li>What are some of the "gotchas"/epiphanies you've had for writing efficient CSS? However your heart tell you to.</li>

                <ul><p>One of the gotchas that I had in clas on this day was that there are many different ways to align items. I was trying to only do text-align for some
                    issues i was having, but I realized that I needed to use the margin property to align elements instead of text. Another moment I had in class today was 
                    when I discovered how to make elements perform actions like hovering in CSS by using a colon. Lastly, I was really happy when I leaened how to add in hyperlinks.
                </p></ul>

        <li>What has your experience learning to code been like so far? What would you change about it?</li>
            <ul><p>My experience elarning code so far has been very positive. I have been able to pick up on the concepts as they're explained in class, and I am learning how to use web tools to discover new ways to design my sites. <br>
                <br>If I could change anything about the experience so far is that it moves a little slower than I expected. I would like to learn more content within the long class periods.</p></ul>
        <li>How do you describe the DOM, as you know it so far?</li>    
            <ul><p>The DOM is the document object model which is the idea that within each window is a document that contains our webpage and all the data that goes into it. This is important to understand because every webpage is designed using this model.</p></ul>
        <li>Can you explain the difference between coding a website to be responsive and using a mobile-first strategy?</li>
            <ul><p>When coding to make a websitee repsonsive this means that we use the @media function. This function allows us to define the min-width of our screens so that the .CSS design elements we apply only apply to screens with a min-width of which we defined. The mobile first strategy is used to make the base model of the website. This is typically easier because we are able to design our larger webpages much easier starting from the smallest pre-sets.</p></ul>
        <li>What does coding look like to you in your mind?</li>
            <ul><p>In my mind coding looks like a time-series of brackets. There is an order to the brackets and the computer reads each one at a time. It is the defining of elements, ids, classes and applying styles and data to these operations. To me coding is like a puzzle that needs to fit just right in order to accomplish the desired goal.</p></ul>
        <li>Where do you see yourself working in 365 days from today? What do you want to be working on?</li>
            <ul><p>I see myself working in my current position as a manager for a couple of entities that aims to transform the massage indisutry through empathy and technology. I also see myself working on some freelance webpage design and some entrpreneurial app designs.</p></ul>
