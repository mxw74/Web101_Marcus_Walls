            <li>Describe one thing you learned in class today.</li>

                <ul><p>One thing I learned in class today is how to display information side-by-side using
                    display flex. This allows us to bypass the cascade effect seen in standard files. I found 
                    this to be particularly interesting and fun to play with. </p></ul>

            <li>Describe 2 pseudo-selectors and discuss what they are used for.</li>

                <ul><p>Two pseudo-selectors I learned about in class today are hover and first-letter. 
                    The hover pseudo selector allows you to make text change whenever a person's mouse 
                    hovers over the text. The first-letter pseudo selector tells our css file to select 
                    every first letter. This is typically used to drop caps. </p></ul>

            <li>What are some of the "gotchas"/epiphanies you've had for writing efficient CSS? However your heart tell you to.</li>

                <ul><p>One of the gotchas that I had in clas on this day was that there are many different ways to align items. I was trying to only do text-align for some
                    issues i was having, but I realized that I needed to use the margin property to align elements instead of text. Another moment I had in class today was 
                    when I discovered how to make elements perform actions like hovering in CSS by using a colon. Lastly, I was really happy when I leaened how to add in hyperlinks.
